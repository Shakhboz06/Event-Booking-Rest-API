### Endpoints
#### Auth
- **POST** `/auth/register`: Register a new user
- **POST** `/auth/login`: Authenticate and receive JWT token

#### Events
- **GET** `/events`: Get a list of events
- **POST** `/events`: Create a new event
- **GET** `/events/{id}`: Get event details by ID
- **PUT** `/events/{id}`: Update event details
- **DELETE** `/events/{id}`: Delete an event

#### Bookings
- **POST** `/bookings`: Create a booking
- **GET** `/bookings/{user_id}`: Retrieve bookings for a specific user
- **DELETE** `/bookings/{booking_id}`: Cancel a booking

### Authentication
- Most endpoints require a JWT token for authorization.
- Use the `/auth/login` endpoint to obtain a token after registering a user.
- Include the token in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>` for protected routes.

### Usage
Examples of common requests:

- **Get Events**:
    ```bash
    curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/events
    ```

- **Create a Booking**:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/bookings \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>" \
        -d '{"event_id": 1, "user_id": 2}'
    ```
